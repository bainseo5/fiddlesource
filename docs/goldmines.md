The Séamus Connolly Collection (Boston College)
The Goldmine: A massive collection of over 330 unique tunes, often recording rare or "correct" regional versions that you can't find on Spotify.
The Problem: It's built for academics, not players. It's often presented as individual pages per tune with heavy text, making it hard to just "listen through" or save to a playlist like our app does.
Potential: Importing these would give us authoritative versions of rare tunes.
2. Rushey Mountain (Paddy Cronin Archive)
The Goldmine: This is a private enthusiast blog dedicated to the legendary Kerry fiddler Paddy Cronin. It has digitized 78s, private house tapes, and radio broadcasts that exist literally nowhere else.
The Problem: It's a blog. To find a tune, you have to scroll through posts from 2010. The audio is often trapped in old players or zip links.
Potential: A "Kerry Fiddle" section in your app to contrast with the "Clare/Doolin" style we currently have.
3. The Alan Lomax Ireland Collection (1951)
The Goldmine: The highest possible fidelity recordings from the 1950s. Recordings of Seamus Ennis and Elizabeth Cronin that pre-date the 70s revival.
The Problem: It lives in the "Cultural Equity" academic database. You have to search by catalog number. It mixes interviews with music indiscriminately.
Potential: We could separate the "Tunes" from the "Talk" (just like we split the sessions) and create a "1951 Field Trip" collection.

4. Donegal Fiddle Music (Cairdeas na bhFidiléirí)
The Goldmine: A dedicated archive for the distinct, aggressive fiddle style of Donegal (John Doherty, Con Cassidy). It mirrors our "Doolin" focus but for the North.
The Problem: It's a "scrapbook" style site. Gems are hidden inside "Micro Sites" for specific players or scattered across blog posts and embedded players.
Potential: A dedicated "Donegal Style" section to contrast with the smooth East Galway style of Cooley.

5. Comhaltas Archive (The "Fleadh" Recordings)
The Goldmine: Decades of recordings from the All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil competitions. This is where you find the raw, sweaty, noisy recordings of legends before they were famous.
The Problem: It's a labyrinth. Thousands of files are buried in paginated HTML lists or associated with old issues of "Treoir" magazine.
Potential: Extracting the "Session Recordings" from the 1960s/70s Fleadhs would create a "Competition Hall" atmosphere that is totally unique.

6. John Kelly | Capel Street (johnkellycapelst.ie)
The Goldmine: A dedicated family-run archive of John Kelly Sr., the legendary fiddler and concertina player from Clare (and The Chieftains). It focuses on his life, his shop on Capel St (a hub for musicians), and includes commercial recordings alongside rare unreleased home tapes.
The Problem: It's strictly organized by "Life Story" and "Shop," making it a beautiful museum but hard to use as a "listening library" for tunes.
Potential: Bringing the "Home Tapes" of John Kelly into the app would provide a masterclass in the "Old Clare" style that predates the Doolin revival.

7. Clare FM "The West Wind" Archives
The Goldmine: Clare FM is the heartbeat of traditional music in the region. Their archives (Soundcloud/Podcasts) are full of "Kitchen Sessions"—informal, high-quality recordings of local masters that were never released commercially.
The Problem: They are locked inside 1-hour podcast episodes. You have to listen to the whole show to find the 3 golden tracks in the middle.
Potential: "The Radio Sessions"—cutting out the talk and ads to leave just the pure, high-quality local sessions.
